title: "Heterogeneous acceleration card for post-quantum cryptography"
excerpt: "The goal is to develop a stand-alone CPU-FPGA acceleration system for post-quantum cryptography like NewHope. Polynomial multiplication, i.e. NTT, is loaded off with the help of an FPGA programmable acceleration card. <br/><img src='/images/foo-bar-identity.jpg'>"

* Develop the following features to achieve high performance.
- Develop a processing element with Montgomery reduction for NTT, further pipeline the dataflow for high frequency.
- Parallel 512 processing elements and develop a high bandwidth storage structure.
- High-speed data transmission interface through a PCIe Gen3 interface.
