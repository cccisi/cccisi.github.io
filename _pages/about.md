I am interested in hardware architecture and security. My research focuses on designing efficient processors for Post-Quantum Cryptography schemes and implementing heterogeneous platforms with FPGA acceleration cards. My future research plan also includes PUF-based secure processors.

Personal experience
======
I learned the knowledge of electronic engineering in the undergraduate program. I started my research and participated in a project in the field of wireless sensor networks when I was a junior. I found that was the most fulfilling period of my undergraduate studies. So I realized that scientific research was my preferred career choice. After my undergraduate program, I decided to continue my research at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). During this period, I began to focus on the implementation of post-quantum cryptography. Under the guidance of my supervisor, I focused on new lattice-based algorithms, especially the candidate algorithms in the NIST standardization competition.

One of my works is an efficient processor for a lattice-based algorithm called Kyber, which provides a good trade-off between area and performance. In this project, I developed a dual-column sequential storage scheme and implemented Gentlemen-Sande butterfly in both forward and inverse NTT computing. This project helps me to be more familiar with the structure of FPGAs. I also learned several skills and techniques for digital circuit design on FPGAs. This work has been published in Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2020).

Another work is a high-performance heterogeneous acceleration card for post-quantum cryptography. The goal is to develop a stand-alone CPU-FPGA acceleration system for post-quantum cryptography like NewHope. In this work, polynomial multiplication, i.e. NTT, is loaded off through a high-speed PCIe Gen3 interface. I try to use parallel processing elements with Montgomery reduction, high bandwidth memory and pipelined dataflow for
high frequency.


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
