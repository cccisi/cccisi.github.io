I am interested in hardware architecture and security. My research focuses on designing efficient processors for Post-Quantum Cryptography schemes and implementing heterogeneous platforms with FPGA acceleration cards. My future research plan also includes PUF-based secure processors.

Personal experience
======
I learned the knowledge of electronic engineering in the undergraduate program. I started my research and participated in a project in the field of wireless sensor networks when I was a junior. I found that was the most fulfilling period of my undergraduate studies. So I realized that scientific research was my preferred career choice. After my undergraduate program, I decided to continue my research at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). During this period, I began to focus on the implementation of post-quantum cryptography. Under the guidance of my supervisor, I focused on new lattice-based algorithms, especially the candidate algorithms in the NIST standardization competition.

One of my works is an efficient processor for a lattice-based algorithm called Kyber, which provides a good trade-off between area and performance. In this project, I developed a dual-column sequential storage scheme and implemented Gentlemen-Sande butterfly in both forward and inverse NTT computing. This project helps me to be more familiar with the structure of FPGAs. I also learned several skills and techniques for digital circuit design on FPGAs. This work has been published in Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2020).

Another work is a high-performance heterogeneous acceleration card for post-quantum cryptography. The goal is to develop a stand-alone CPU-FPGA acceleration system for post-quantum cryptography like NewHope. In this work, polynomial multiplication, i.e. NTT, is loaded off through a high-speed PCIe Gen3 interface. I try to use parallel processing elements with Montgomery reduction, high bandwidth memory and pipelined dataflow for
high frequency.
